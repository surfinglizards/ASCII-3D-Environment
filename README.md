# ASCII-3D-Environment
A "3D" environment inpsired from doom using nothing but ASCII. This was originally written in C++ intented to use command prompt but has be rewriten using JavaFX.

The major differences between my version and the orginal is the one in Java use a label and doesn't have a while loop for the game loop. 
The "game" runs off of an animation timer which caps the frame rate to 60.

# Issues
- Map doesn't fully render (renders half)

## Disclaimer

inspired by javidx9's Youtube video "Code-It-Yourself!
